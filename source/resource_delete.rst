How to delete data
======================================

:ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` allows to delete uploaded and connected geodata by deleting the corresponding resources (:ref:`Vector layers <ngcom_vector_layer>`, :ref:`Raster layers <ngcom_raster_layer>`, :ref:`PostGIS layers <ngcom_postgis_layer>`, :ref:`WMS layers <ngcom_postgis_layer>`). 

To delete a resource:

#. Open the Properties page of a resource you want to delete;
#. Select :menuselection:`Action --> Delete` on the right side of Web GIS :ref:`admin console <ngw_admin_interface>`;
#. In the opened dialog dialog window in :guilabel:`Delete reaource` tab check the box :guilabel:`Confirm deletion of the resource`;
#. Press :guilabel:`Delete` button. If a resource is deleted successfully its name will disappear from the relevant :ref:`Resource group <ngcom_resources_group>`.

.. note:: 

	In the same way you can delete from Web GIS other resources (:ref:`PostGIS and WMS connections <ngcom_data_connect>`, :ref:`WMS and WFS services <ngcom_data_services>`, :ref:`Styles <ngcom_styles>`, :ref:`Resource groups <ngcom_resources_group>`).
