How to use Web GIS for creation of end-user apps
=====================================================================


:ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` can be used as a backend for web, mobile and desktop apps which need to read, write and visualize geodata. This is possible due to the existense of NextGIS API which allows to perform wide range of requests to Web GIS. 

Read more about NextGIS API :ref:`here <ngw_api_description>`. 

Developers can deploy Web GIS :ref:`at their own server <ngw_sysadmin_tasks>` (in this case we recommend subsribing to one of our `support programs <http://nextgis.com/services/support/>`_) or use our `online service <http://nextgis.com/>`_. 

Online service saves you from all Web GIS installation and tuning problems and provides unlimited space [1]_ for geodata storage and free [1]_ use of :term:`API`.
