=====================================================================


:ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` can be used as a backend for web, mobile and desktop apps which need to read, write and visualize geodata. This is possible due to existence of NextGIS API which allows to perform wide range of requests to Web GIS.

Using Web GIS API you can turn into a geodata storage for other maps and systems. Access for other domains can be provied after you sign up for `Mini <http://nextgis.com/nextgis-com/plans>`_ plan, where API access from other websites is turned on through `CORS <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>`_.
