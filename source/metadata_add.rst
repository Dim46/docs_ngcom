How to add descriptions and metadata for resources
=====================================================================

For any resource in :ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` you can add Description and Metadata. It can be necessary, for instance, in order to publish a dataset under a certain license. 

To add Description and/or Metadata after resource is created:

#. Open the Properties page of a resource;
#. Select :menuselection:`Action --> Update` on the right side of Web GIS :ref:`admin console <ngw_admin_interface>`;
#. **If you want to add Description**: In the opened dialog window go to :guilabel:`Description` tab and fill it;
#. **If you want to add Metadata**: In the opened dialog window go to :guilabel:`Metadata` tab, add required metadata fields with :guilabel:`Add` button and fill in their Keys and Values;
#. Press :guilabel:`Save` button. If Description and Metadata are added successfully you'll see them on the Properties page of a resource.

.. note:: 
	The following metadata field types are supported: Text, Integer, Float.
